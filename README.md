# Automated-Watering-Plant

A substantial number of modern systems for soil moisture measurement exploit two properties of soils: moisture content and water potential. Sensors for measuring these parameters vary substantially in precision and cost. Moisture content sensors provide data that is more suitable for human reading. Smart irrigation systems can improve crop yields while saving water. Smart irrigation systems use IoT devices with soil moisture and temperature/humidity sensors to determine the amount of moisture in the soil and air, hotness in the environment and release the flow of water through the irrigation pipes only when the moisture levels/temperature go below/beyond a predefined threshold. Smart irrigation systems also collect moisture level measurements on a server or in the cloud where the collected data can be analyzed to plan watering schedules.
